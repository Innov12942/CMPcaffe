# DeepCompression for Caffe
A simple implementation of Deep Compression: Compressing Deep Neural Networks with Pruning, Trained Quantization and Huffman coding, with convolutional layer only. 
# Calculate Compression ratio#
/Test/caffe/pt.cpp.<br>
Read weight values from caffemodel and calculate theoretical compression ratio.
Need to changes paths to compile.
